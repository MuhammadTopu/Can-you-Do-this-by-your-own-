    <!-- Causes of Pollution -->
    <h2>Causes of Environmental Pollution</h2>
    <p>
        Pollution stems from several human activities such as industrial emissions, improper waste disposal, 
        and excessive use of fossil fuels. <br>
        Some causes include:
        <br>1. <b>Industrial Waste:</b> Factories release harmful chemicals into the air and water.
        <br>2. <b>Deforestation:</b> Clearing trees reduces air purification.
        <br>3. <b>Vehicle Emissions:</b> Cars and trucks emit carbon monoxide and other toxins.
    </p>

    <!-- Types of Pollution -->
    <h2>Types of Pollution</h2>
    <p>
        There are several forms of pollution that we must address:
        <br><i>1. Air Pollution:</i> Smoke, carbon monoxide, and other gases pollute the atmosphere. 
        <br><i>2. Water Pollution:</i> Dumping chemicals and garbage into water bodies affects aquatic life. 
        <br><i>3. Soil Pollution:</i> Non-biodegradable waste degrades the land.
    </p>
